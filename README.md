# Homework 01 - Submission


* Student: YOUR NAME
* Semester: SEMESTER

## Common

* List any coding practice problems you completed, feel free to comment at needed (did it help, was it too easy, etc):

* List any other resources you used to help you complete the assignment (make sure to share good ones to the Tips,Tricks, and Resources channel in teams!):
  

## Module Specific

1. In IDLE shell or python interpreter directly, try the following code:
   ```python
   x = 10 + "5"
   ```

    a. What is the error message you get?  (copy and paste it below - you don't need to include the Traceback lines, just the error message including type of error)
    
    b. Describe in your own words the error message. What does it mean?  (you can use the internet to help you, but make sure to cite your source)

    c. There are multiple ways this error can be fixed. However, converting between types is common, and it is called "casting" (think of actors on a stage). Take time to research online how to cast between types in python.  What is the correct way to cast the string "5" to an `int`?  Write code below in the block below
    ```python
    # write your code here
    
    ```

## Deeper Thinking

 For star_rating and hobby_card, we built strings and then printed out the results. Why would we want to build strings, and then print out the results, than just printing out the results directly? Don't need a correct answer, but we encourage you to ponder this question and come up with reasons on why this would be a good design pattern.  Add your answer below, around a paragraph in length.
